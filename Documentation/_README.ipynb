    "The input and output are handled with Python. We suggest to use Anaconda to install Python and all the required packages. In order to facilitate the installation we provide a [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) containg all the required packages. The `geoframe_vicenza.yaml` file can be downloaded from [python4GEOframe](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/python4GEOframe).\n",
    "\n",
    "After having installed [Anconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) the Conda environment can be created following these steps:\n",
    "- open Anaconda prompt\n",
    "- set in the folder containing the file *geoframe_vicenza.yaml*\n",
